#### Would have been Turnkey if not for a slick little typo. Now, we can enjoy Thankgsiving dinner. 

### Dev Work Flow:

-Run git pull origin main from the project's root directory to get the latest updates

-Checkout a new branch and give it a decriptive name that relates to the task you've picked up using git checkout -b name-of-your-branch-relating-to-task

-Make your changes and test that the program still works

-run git add . to track all your changes

-run git commit -m "message about your changes" to create a commit with a message

-Push your changes to a newly created remote version of your branch by using: git push origin name-of-your-branch-relating-to-task

In Github, review your changes, push any additional changes and then when everything looks good to go you can create a new pull request
